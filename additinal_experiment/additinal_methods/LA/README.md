This is the code of paper "A Light-weight, Effective and Efficient Model for Label Aggregation in Crowdsourcing" published on ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data.

------

**Implemented methods**: we use pure python to implement MV, LA<sup>onepass</sup>,  LA<sup>twopass</sup>, MV, DS, LFC, ZC, EBCC, BWA, iCRH, TILCC and SBIC.

BiLA, LAA and TiReMGE require Tensorflow to run, we use their authors' implementation and they can be downloaded from:

- BiLA: https://github.com/ChiHong-Xtautau/BiLA-OnlineLabelAggregation
- LAA: https://github.com/coverdark/deep_laa
- TiReMGE: https://github.com/lazyloafer/TiReMGE

------

**Usage**: the scripts of the experiments are in the *experiments* package.

**Requirements**: the algorithms only require standard Python libraries to run. Numpy, pandas and matplotlib are used to summarize the results and plot.

------

**Dataset**: 20 datasets used in the experiments are in the *dataset* folder. Their links and sources are given below:

- *senti* and *fact* are collected from  CrowdScale 2013 (Josephy et al. 2014). They can be downloaded at https://sites.google.com/site/crowdscale2013/home.
- *MS*, *ZC\_in*, *ZC\_us*, *ZC\_all*, *SP*, *SP\_amt*, *CF* and *CF\_amt* are from Active Crowd Toolkit project (Venanzi et al. 2015). They can be downloaded at https://github.com/orchidproject/active-crowd-toolkit.
- *prod*, *tweet*, *dog*, *face* and *adult* are collected from Truth Inference Project (Zheng et al. 2017). They can be downloaded at http://dbgroup.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/ligl/crowddata/.
- *bird*, *rte*, *web* and *trec* are used in (Zhang et al. 2014). They can be downloaded at https://github.com/zhangyuc/SpectralMethodsMeetEM.
- *mill* is collected from a "Who wants to be a millionaire app" (Aydin, Yilmaz, and Demirbas 2021). It can be downloaded from https://github.com/bahadiri/Millionaire.
